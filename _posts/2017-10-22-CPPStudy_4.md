<br/>We can use movesementic for the movement of object data.
<br/>It helps us to optimize our codes and to protect against memory leak
<br/>If you use move sementic, when you use vector or something containner, It prevents just copy memory. 
<br/>By moving object data instead of using copy, Our mistake such as reference wrong memory address would be protected.
<br/>You can found detail information about lambda here.

<br/>Very simple example is uploaded my github.
