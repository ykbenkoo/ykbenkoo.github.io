Basic Concepts of Data Modelling
<br/>
<br/>[Data Model]
<br/> - a model is an abstraction of some aspect of a problem
<br/> - a data model is a model-lets you understand the structure of data
<br/>
<br/>[Entity-Relationship Model]
<br/> - Building Blocks
<br/> : Entities - person or objects of interest
<br/> : Entity set - a collection of entities that have something in common
<br/> : Attributes - a data associated with an entity 
<br/> : Relationship - a connection between 2 entities
<br/>
<br/>[UML Class Diagram]
<br/> - Class : box with a name
<br/> - Attribute : a line of text written inside a class box
<br/> - Association : a line that connects between entity sets denotes a relationship
<br/> : Broken line : Association table to relative table
<br/> - Cardinality types - 1:1, 1:M, M:N
<br/>
<br/>[Characteristic of Data Models]
<br/> - Functional Requirements
<br/> : Come mostly from stakeholder and describe what software system should do
<br/> - Non-functional Requirements
<br/> : How the software system should perform specific functions
<br/> : How the internal structure of the system is designed
<br/> : To consist performance, security, usability
<br/> - Non Functional Requirements Characteristic
<br/> : Reusability : how a big part of the data model can be reused
<br/> : Extensibility : the cost we pay for extending the set of functional features with others
<br/> : Changeability : the cost we pay for changes made in the existing data model
<br/> : Complexity : the number of building blocks present in the data model
