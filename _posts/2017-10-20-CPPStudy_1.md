Use Atomic and cout.sync_with_stdio(true)
<br/>
<br/>In thread environment, we can use atomic for protecting race condition which can lead to raise wrong result.
<br/>If you utilise atomic, we can make thread safe status without std::lock.
<br/>When you use atomic, compilor execute this code in parallel type. 
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>atomic<int> counter(0); //Global variable
<br/>...
<br/>++counter; //Excute multiple thread
<br/>
<br/>Now It is thread safe code without add lock.
<br/>If you adapt it for 'cout', you are able to use cout.sync_with_stdio(true);.
