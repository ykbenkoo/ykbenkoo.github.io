SOLID - Summary
<br/>
<br/>Single Resposibility Principle
<br/> - A class should only have one reason to change
<br/> - Separation of concerns - different classes handling different, independent/task/problems
<br/>
<br/>Open-Closed Principle
<br/> - Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification
<br/>
<br/>Liskov Substition Principle
<br/> - You should be able to substitute a base type for a sub type
<br/>
<br/>Interface Segregation Principle
<br/> - Don't put too much into an interface; split into separate interfaces
<br/> - YANGI - You Ain't Going to Need it
<br/>
<br/>Dependency Inversion Principle
<br/> - High-level modules should not depend on low-level  ones; use abstractions.
